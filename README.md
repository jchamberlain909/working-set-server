workingSet
=====

workingSet is a drawing distribution platform for the construction industry. It attempts to solve the problems related to keeping contractors up to date with an evolving set of project drawings.

## Introduction

With workingSet users can create or be invited to join an existing company. Through a company users can collaborate on contruction projects. These projects have a list of followers who will receive updates to the project drawings. Anytime a new set of drawings are issued they can be easily uploaded to a project with an update message. They will then be sent out to all followers of a project with a unique URL to download the files. When a follower downloads the project drawings via their unique URL it is recorded and displayed on a project page.
